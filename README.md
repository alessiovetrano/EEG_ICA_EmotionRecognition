# ICA_EmotionRecognition
Project based on ICA, CCNN, GCNN for emotion recognition.
This project aims to explore the field of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in the context of training neural networks for emotion recognition using the SEED IV dataset.

Throughout this study, various methodologies and approaches have been explored in training neural networks for emotion recognition. Among these, particular emphasis has been placed on the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) as an analytical tool for preprocessing EEG signals. This technique allows for the separation of signals from different neural sources, enabling a more accurate and detailed analysis of the data.
During this study, in addition to applying Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for preprocessing EEG signals, various approaches in training neural networks for emotion recognition have been explored. In particular, a Continuos Convolutional Neural Network (CCNN) and a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) have been utilized. These two models are based on different approaches in data analysis.
